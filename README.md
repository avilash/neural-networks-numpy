## Neural Networks in Numpy

The following repository contains code for training neural networks only in numpy. It is a attempt to encourage an encourage a clear understanding of how neural networks are trained : **Backprop** and **Gradient Descent**

### FC Network - Regression
---
[Function_Regression.ipynb](Function_Regression.ipynb)
The notebook contains code to train a neural network to overfit any function in a given range 
	
### FC Network - Classification
---
[Classification_MNIST.ipynb](Classification_MNIST.ipynb)
The notebook aims at training a neural network to classify the digits in the MNIST dataset

### TODO
